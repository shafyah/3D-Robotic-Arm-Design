# 3D Robotic Arm Design â€“ Educational Simulation with Tinkercad

This project presents a 3D model of a multi-jointed robotic arm designed in Tinkercad to simulate precise mechanical movement. It serves as an **educational tool** to understand the fundamentals of robotic joint motion and mechanics. The design respects engineering principles of movement, balance, and is scalable for integration with control systems like Arduino.

##  Project Goals

- Provide an educational model to study joint mechanics and robotic arm movement.
- Create a scalable design ready for integration with real control hardware.
- Offer a practical and functional mechanical design for industrial robotic arms.

##  Design Components

- **Stable Base:** Ensures full stability of the arm during operation.
- **Two-Jointed Arm:** Allows flexible vertical movement.
- **Front Gripper:** Simulates object grasping and manipulation.

## Project Contents

- `3D Robotic Arm Design.stl`: 3D model file in STL format.
